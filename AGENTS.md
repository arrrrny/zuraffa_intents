# Agent Guidelines for zuraffa_intents

## ZURAFFA MISFIRE RULE (HARD, NON-NEGOTIABLE — HARDCODED TOP RULE)

**On ANY misfire (test failure, compilation error, runtime crash, unexpected output) related to zuraffa:**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to zuraffa GitHub (`arrrrny/zuraffa`) with: the command that failed, expected vs actual output, and root cause.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass (e.g., skip the failing test, use an alternative approach, or mock the failing component).
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied and linking to the zuraffa GitHub issue.

**On ANY misfire related to the repo itself (not zuraffa):**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to the repo's GitHub with full details.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass.
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied.

This rule takes precedence over all other rules. Never skip a misfire or rationalize it away.


## Test concurrency (fleet guard)

Cap test concurrency at **2** — one un-capped `flutter test` fan starved the
shared host's services once (load 260; arrrrrny/forklift#176).

There is **no config-file knob for `flutter test`**: it ignores
`dart_test.yaml` entirely (its only test-config file is
`flutter_test_config.dart`, an execution hook), so the flag is the only
lever — and it must be passed every time:

```sh
flutter test --concurrency=2
dart test -j 2
```

CI carries the same flags in `.github/workflows`. Never raise the number on a
host that also runs the forklift pool.
