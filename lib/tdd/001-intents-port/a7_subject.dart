// GENERATED IMPLEMENTATION — `zfa tdd compose A7` (issue
// #642; spec 052-acceptance-make-composition: the acceptance subject is
// composed against the feature's green / entity-wired unit subjects by a
// generation-pipeline step, never by a wrapper or by hand).
//
// behavior_id: A7
// source_criterion: AC-7
// composed against: U1 (/Users/arrrrny/Developer/zuraffa_intents/lib/tdd/001-intents-port/u1_subject.dart)
// description: the late subscriber
//
// This replaces the `zfa tdd gen` stub with the minimal composed
// implementation (spec 047 FR-005): the feature's unit subjects are the
// implementation anchors. An anchor marked [entity-wired] carries only
// the `zfa tdd wire` wiring so far (issue #923) — the composed scenario's
// real green transition lands when those unit subjects are filled with
// business logic in later cycles. Extend the body with real behavior in
// later cycles — the paired test file is immutable (044 ownership).
//
// The subject name is derived from the behavior id (`subject_a7`) and is
// deliberately snake_cased — the generator KNOWS the name it emits, so
// the lint its shape provably trips is suppressed here rather than
// renaming the contract surface (issue #1035).
// ignore_for_file: non_constant_identifier_names
